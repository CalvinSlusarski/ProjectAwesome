::New Structure::
GameObject: all ingame objects inherit.
|-> Player: now inherits GameObject!
|--> Enemy: needs to be updated to work with new system,  now inherits GameObject!
|---> Projectiles: currently working,  now inherits GameObject!
GameObjectManagement: works kinda like game1 but manages the ingame scene, using this so,
					that we can place a many over it.
